# 🌿 Psychedelicraft - Drugs Addon for Minecraft Bedrock

** Disclaimer: This mod is for entertainment purposes only. I do not approve of drug usage and activities from this addon should not be recreated irl.

** Credit: I do not own any of the textures used they were ported from the original java [Psychedelicraft](https://github.com/Ivorforce/Psychedelicraft) mod. This is a fork of the original mod to fix it after HCF was removed from Bedrock
